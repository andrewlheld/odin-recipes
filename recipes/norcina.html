    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>This hearty Italian pasta hails from the town of Norcia located in Umbria, and is loaded with homemade sausage and mushrooms in a creamy white wine</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 Package Tube Pasta</li>
        <li>1 lb Spicy Ground Sausage</li>
        <li>16 oz Cremini Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Dry White Wine</li>
        <li>1 cup Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>1 cup Parmesan</li>
        <li>2 cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>1 shallot</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon nutmeg</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Start heating a pot of water to cook the pasta in with a pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Get a skillet and put to medium/high heat. After 2 minutes when pan is hot add sausage</li>
        <li>While sausage is browing, finely dice mushrooms, shallots, and garlic adding the mushrooms first when the sausage is fulyl cooked on the outside. Put heat to medium/low</li>
        <li>Pasta water should begin to boil so add pasta and stir every minute to make sure pasta does not stick together. Pasta should take no longer than 12 minutes to get to a nice al dente</li>
        <li>Once mushrooms have shrunk due to the loss of water from heat, add the diced shallots and stir everything together</li>
        <li>Now is the time to add salt and pepper to taste and the minced garlic </li>
        <li>Once all the ingredients are mixed together and cooked, deglaze the pan with a 1/3 cup of the white wine</li>
        <li>At this point the pasta should nearly be done so have a strainer ready on hand</li>
        <li>Once all the white wine has evaporated, add heavy cream and parmesan and continuously stir while heat is on simmer</li>
        <li>The sauce should start to develop and thicken, once it starts bubbling at the nutmeg and drained pasta</li>
        <li>At this point you can turn off the heat and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
